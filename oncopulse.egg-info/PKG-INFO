# OncoPulse

OncoPulse is an ad hoc oncology research inbox for clinicians. It ingests recent PubMed items, ClinicalTrials.gov updates, and OpenAlex citation counts, then applies transparent rule-based ranking and strict structured summaries.

## Features (V1)
- Specialty/subcategory selection from YAML packs
- Ad hoc run with time window + filters
- Transparent scoring with per-item "why ranked"
- Strict summarization from source text only
- Tabs for New & Relevant, Most Cited, and Trial Updates
- Local stars + notes in SQLite

## Quick Start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. (Optional) Set environment variables:

```bash
export NCBI_API_KEY="..."
export NCBI_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export NCBI_TOOL="OncoPulse"
export ONCOPULSE_DB_PATH="oncopulse.db"
```

4. Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

5. Start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Notes
- V1 uses only public/allowed metadata and abstracts.
- If abstract text is missing, summaries explicitly say so.
